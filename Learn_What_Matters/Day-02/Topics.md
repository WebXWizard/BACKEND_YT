3.  Why not Frontend alone ?
    Because frontend alone can only display static content, while backend is needed to handle data, logic, security, and dynamic features that make an application truly functional.
    With Frontend websites are static and they are of much use

4.  What do we need to build Backend ?
    Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express.js
    For backend development, you need a programming language, framework, database, server, and tools for APIs, security, version control, and deployment.
